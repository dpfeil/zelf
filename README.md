# zelf

Zelf is an attempt to create a personal management system that works for me (and hopefully others).

## Encouragement and advice

## Daily checklists

This is different than tasks. These are more regular every day tasks that help you build and keep habits or a routine. It helps to be able to keep yourself accountable for a specific set of items you want to complete each day. For example, waking up on time, taking a shower, meditating, or going to bed on time.

## Task management

I like to be able to focus on a daily list of tasks, whether they are for personal or work related items. This resulted in a lot of duplication of items from day to day, or items getting lost in the shuffle.

Zelf works off of a comprehensive todo list, allowing you to reference a subset of tasks for a specific day. This will also allow zelf to determine how many days a task has been on a list (and not completed) and try to encourage you get it done (maybe be able to set a limit of days where it will poke you about it).

Zelf will also keep track of when you create a task, the number of days that task was included and when that task is complete. This will allow users to be able to see some metrics on what tasks, or types of tasks, are harder to complete than others.

## Event management

For me, keeping upcoming events or obligations in my head can be difficult. I often am asked if I am free, I pause to think and come up with nothing, and agree to the time. Then later I go look at my calendar and realize I already had something scheduled. This can happen for obligations as soon as the following day.

I like to keep a few different lists (each with different promenance) of upcoming events. First are the events scheduled for that day. Second are the events for the next couple of days. Third are the events for the next seven days, and finally the fourth is the next 5-10 events after the end of the week.

`0 | 1 2 | 3 4 5 6 | -> 5-10 events past that.`

While having a calendar and accessing it helps a lot, constantly seeing the events daily helps me keep them on my mind when I happen to be talking to someone and a calendar is out of reach. It just forces events, appointments and obligations into my brain on a regular basis.
